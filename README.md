### **Unsolved Problems & Future Enhancements**
* A filter-by side bar was a major component of the application. Users should be able to filter through the index page to display the cars that has their preferred characteristics, such as car type (i.e SUV, sedan) or car make (i.e. Toyota, Chevrolet, Mazda). However, this feature’s functionality hasn’t been implemented in the application.
* Review and rate. Renters must be able to review the cars and rate their experience and owners must also write a review of their experience with the renter. This features serves to display honest reviews and recommendations for other users that want to use the application.
* Owner’s profile page and car information page can be enhanced and better styled in future iterations of the applicatiom.
* An option to sign up with Google can make the process of signing up faster and easier.
